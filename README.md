Past Looking Glass

How We Did It

The first step to making this project was finding the data. We used multiple sources, then cleaned and compiled the data.

For age of marriage, we used this site: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html

For how many kids a woman had, we used this one: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_01_tables.pdf#i01

Job status statistics were from here: http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2002/05/art2full.pdf

The living arrangements data was here: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/11/record-share-of-young-women-are-living-with-their-parents-relatives/

And income data was found here: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/people/

Once we had this data, we compiled into a spreadsheet for timelines generated by the Knight Lab. Here is an example of the spreadsheet:

We made one of these for every two years, for example 19-20 year olds, 21-22 year olds, etc.

We included photos on the slides that we got from family members who were young women in each decade.

Once we put this data in the spreadsheets, we were able to generate timelines here:

 http://timeline.knightlab.com

Lauren and Kelly did the timelines, and then sent them to Raul, who input the link to each individual timeline in a drop-down menu calculator.

Once this calculator was working, we pushed it forward on github.

The hardest part was cleaning some of the data, and finding the data. We were all very surprised that this data wasn’t more accessible, especially considering the recent discourse concerning feminism and women’s rights. We also had to choose exactly how to present the data, and think we chose the most cohesive way.
